# ezcox: an R Package for Cox Model Batch Processing and Visualization - An Use Case

Cox analysis is a common analysis technique to link variable to clinical outcome. In the omics era, Cox model batch processing is a basic strategy for screening clinical relevant variables, biomarker discovery and gene signature identification. However, all such analyses have been implemented with homebrew code in research community, thus lack of transparency and reproducibility. ezcox is born to address this issue for open science.
